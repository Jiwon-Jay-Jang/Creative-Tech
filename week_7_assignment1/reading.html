    <h1>1-1. We are now in transition from an object-oriented to a systems-oriented culture. Here change emanates, not from things, but from the way things are done.</h1>

    <p>I think this is a powerful sentence that captures the current trends in technology and design. The phrase 'the way things are done' is particularly impactful, as it highlights the role of IoT devices and a connected society in generating large amounts of data. Objects that only serve their own function no longer hold much significance; instead, dynamic interactions and experiences where objects and people, as well as objects and other objects, communicate and influence each other, have become essential.</p>


    <h1>1-2. Second, code enables designers to do things they couldn't do before.</h1>

    <p>This statement reflects one of the reasons I chose MDP. Prototyping and coding are my weaknesses and areas I need to improve. To address my shortcomings, I deliberately immersed myself in the dynamic prototyping environment of MDP. Learning to code, I feel how far technology has advanced and see how much the world has progressed. Previously, while focusing on user-centered design, my attention was mainly on the user. These days, however, my focus has shifted to technology itself. I'm beginning to understand how the designs I've worked on can actually be implemented and what kinds of logic are used to bring current designs to life. Prototyping also helps me discover new ideas or identify design problems, which has deepened my appreciation for the power of code and technology.</p>


    <h1>1-3. How to use code to create new and interesting graphic designs, and how to evaluate whether these designs can be considered successful.</h1>

    <p>It's a sentence that reflects my mindset today as I learn about technology (coding). Previously, I thought coding limited my creativity because trying to create digitally gave me a sense of pressure to make things look better than my hand-drawn work. However, coding has actually given me more freedom by allowing me to turn my ideas into reality, which leads to even more creative thinking.Building on the idea from the previous sentence, coding not only produces the final result of an object but also reveals multiple snapshots of the process as the object operates. By observing these intermediate stages of operation, I feel it becomes possible to gain new ideas and inspiration.</p>


    <h1>2-1. Prototypes provide the means for examining design problems and evaluating solutions.</h1>

    <p>It was such an interesting sentence. I had never thought of prototypes as a way to examine design problems. I always thought problem identification was done through user-centered design methodologies, but now that I think about it, I've discovered many practical design issues while working with prototypes, and I still find new ones even now.And issues related to algorithms and usability are also design problems. I have mainly focused on social issues, but this statement has broadened my perspective on what constitutes a "design problem" and has challenged my preconceived notions.</p>


    <h1>2-2. Finally, prototypes are not self explanatory: looks can be deceiving. Clarifying what aspects of a prototype correspond to the eventual artifact—and what don’t—is a key part of successful prototyping. Prototypes themselves do not necessarily communicate their purpose; it is up to the designer to prepare an audience for viewing a prototype.</h1>

    <p>Yes, conveying the purpose and intent of a design through prototypes is crucial for designers. When ambition grows, it often leads to adding too many elements to the design, which can dilute its clarity. Prototyping should focus on clearly defining and visually expressing only the most essential aspects of the final product. I believe the key lies in the process of minimalization—removing unnecessary elements to enhance communication and ensure the design's core message is effectively delivered.</p>


    <h1>2-3. A prototype may explore questions or design options in one, two, or all three dimensions of the model: role, look and feel, and implementation.</h1>

    <p>Prototyping serves as a powerful tool that clearly conveys the purpose and intent of a design. It bridges the gaps between role, usability, aesthetics, and the actual implementation, facilitating effective communication with collaborators. By showcasing the essence of a design, prototyping becomes a compelling method to demonstrate its objectives and rationale. Reading the two articles has deepened my understanding of the importance of prototyping. As I mentioned earlier, prototyping and coding are areas where I lack confidence but are also the skills I am determined to develop. I joined the MDP program precisely to challenge myself in this dynamic field. Moving forward, I will strive to keep the purpose of prototyping at the forefront of my mind as I continue to learn and grow in this area.</p>
