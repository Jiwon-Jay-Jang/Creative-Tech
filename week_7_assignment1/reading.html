    <h1>1-1. We are now in transition from an object-oriented to a systems-oriented culture. Here change emanates, not from things, but from the way things are done.</h1>

    <p>I think this is a powerful sentence that captures the current trends in technology and design. The phrase 'the way things are done' is particularly impactful, as it highlights the role of IoT devices and a connected society in generating large amounts of data.</p>


    <h1>1-2. Second, code enables designers to do things they couldn't do before.</h1>

    <p>Learning to code, I feel how far technology has advanced and see how much the world has progressed. Previously, while focusing on user-centered design, my attention was mainly on the user. These days, however, my focus has shifted to technology itself. I'm beginning to understand how the designs I've worked on can actually be implemented and what kinds of logic are used to bring current designs to life. This has made me appreciate the power of code and technology even more.</p>


    <h1>1-3. How to use code to create new and interesting graphic designs, and how to evaluate whether these designs can be considered successful.</h1>

    <p>It's a sentence that reflects my mindset today as I learn about technology (coding). Previously, I thought coding limited my creativity because trying to create digitally gave me a sense of pressure to make things look better than my hand-drawn work. However, coding has actually given me more freedom by allowing me to turn my ideas into reality, which leads to even more creative thinking.</p>


    <h1>2-1. Prototypes provide the means for examining design problems and evaluating solutions.</h1>

    <p>It was such an interesting sentence. I had never thought of prototypes as a way to examine design problems. I always thought problem identification was done through user-centered design methodologies, but now that I think about it, I've discovered many practical design issues while working with prototypes, and I still find new ones even now.</p>


    <h1>2-2. Finally, prototypes are not self explanatory: looks can be deceiving. Clarifying what aspects of a prototype correspond to the eventual artifact—and what don’t—is a key part of successful prototyping.</h1>

    <p>It's very impressive that prototypes are not just about their appearance but also require clarity regarding the intentions and functions behind them. I realized that relying solely on the external design does not provide a complete understanding of the user's experience. I believe that recognizing and analyzing this complexity is essential for successful prototyping.</p>


    <h1>2-3.  This example shows that prototypes are not necessarily self-explanatory.</h1>

    <p>It's very impressive that prototypes are not just about their appearance but also require clarity regarding the intentions and functions behind them.
